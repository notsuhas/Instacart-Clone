## Task Checklist

- **What's done ‚úÖ**

  - A Static Clone of the given website.
  - Mobile First and Responsive.
  - Hosted on Netlify.

- **What's NOT done ‚ùå**

  - Site is Fully Responsive Until Generic Laptop Displays, <br>
    Beyond that breakpoint website ain't that pretty.
  - Accessibility was Ignored for the sake of time.
  - The Two Footers was Ignored.
  - Although there isn't much of State Management, <br>
    the Country Switcher is not in sync with the Mobile NavBar. <br>
    ContextAPI could have been used but that would be overkill for a NavElement.
  - All the Links are Dummy.

- **Extra üí°**

  - All Data has been properly organized in `data.js`.
  - A Frankly better Carousel List was implemented with hover states.
  - A Kinda not so clunky Mobile Nav Country Switcher was implemented, <br>
    a bit better than requiring 4 clicks and full context takeover.

- **Bug üêõ**

  - The Country Flag in the Hero Section, doesn't appear to be clipped in circle, <br>
    It works fine in the Mobile Nav though. Couldn't find solution for that.

## Libraries Used

    "tailwindcss"
    "headlessui/react"
    "tailwind-scrollbar-hide"

This project was bootstrapped with **Create React App** and **TailwindCSS** in **JIT Mode**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
